This repository contains a framework for building parsers using the Pratt technique.  The Pratt technique is a recursive descent parsing technique specifically geared toward enabling more efficient parsing of grammars involving operator precedence, such as expression grammars.  The repository also contains other functionality to assist in the creation of lexical analyzers and other code useful for parsers.
